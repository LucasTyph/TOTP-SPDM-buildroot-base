## USB SPDM Gadget 

Should be added to the kernel's files and compiled with Buildroot.

Based on [xairy's raw-gadget](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget), commit 20dfa8b4ccd0ce80baa308000e2a5693247788f2, and uses Buildroot version 2022.02.7, with the `galileo_defconfig` default configuration as a starting point.
